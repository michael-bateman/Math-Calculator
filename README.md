# Math Calculator

## About

I made this simple Math Calculator as one of my first projects in Java in my computer science class. This project was compiled with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) so see the actual code, navigate to the `src` directory.

The following calculators are included:
* Pythagorean Theorem
* Mod Simplifier
* Volume of a Sphere
